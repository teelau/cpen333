# Lab 3 - Testing and Mutexes

In this lab, we will learn about unit testing, and will get some practice with thread synchronization using mutexes.  First we will create a method that counts the number of words in a string, and test this thoroughly to ensure reliability under a variety of circumstances.  Next, we will use this method to help us count how many words each character has to memorize in a collection of plays by Shakespeare.  We will then switch gears and look at synchronization between multiple processes.
