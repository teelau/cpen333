# Lab 2 -- Multi-Threading

In this lab we will get some practice with multi-threading.  We have three
example problems to try: speeding up the QuickSort algorithm, numerically
estimating the value of PI using Monte-Carlo methods, and computing the
centre of mass of a variable-density sphere using Monte-Carlo integration.
